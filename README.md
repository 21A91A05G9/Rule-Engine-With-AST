# Rule Engine with AST

## Project Overview
The Rule Engine with Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) is a 3-tier application designed to determine user eligibility based on various attributes such as age, department, income, and spending. By representing conditional rules as ASTs, the system allows for dynamic creation, combination, and modification of rules, providing flexibility in eligibility assessments.

## Features
- **Dynamic Rule Creation**: Users can create eligibility rules using a user-friendly interface.
- **Rule Combination**: Multiple rules can be combined into a single logical structure, allowing for complex eligibility checks.
- **Rule Evaluation**: The engine evaluates rules against user data to determine eligibility.
- **Error Handling**: The application includes robust error handling for invalid rule strings and data formats.
- **Modifiable Rules**: Users can modify existing rules, enhancing adaptability.
- **User-Defined Functions**: Future extensions may support advanced conditions through user-defined functions.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Testing**: Jest or Mocha/Chai
